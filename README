sphinx_latexnewfloat extends Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/) latex builder to
replace literal-block environment and \caption command by inserting inline \captionof command.
For \captionof command, newfloat and capt-of packages are required instead of legacy float package.
This extention may help when one inserts a long source code using code-block or literalinclude directive
with **caption option** and one needs page break within the literal code.
